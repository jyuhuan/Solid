# Solid

**Solid** is a library of abstract data structures and algorithms written in 
Swift.

This library offers highly customizable data structures and algorithms ready for 
use out of the box:

- Search algorithm (`SearchProblem`). 
- Graph algorithms (`shortestPaths()`, `transitiveClosure()`).
- Probabilistic data structures (`BloomFilter`, `CountMinSketch`).

Solid also provides abstract protocols and structures that makes writing
extensible code easy:  

- Protocols for algebraic structures (e.g., ``Monoid``, ``Semiring``). Write 
  code that interact with these protocols instead of concrete implementations
- More in progress.
